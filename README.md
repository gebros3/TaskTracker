# Task Tracker

Task Tracker is a simple web app that allows users to track their tasks and stay on top of deadlines. Users can add a task, choose when it's a due, and it will appear in a list that puts the most urgent tasks at the top. Users can remove a task by simply clicking on a button to the right of each task. The ask supports persistent storage, storing task information in a redis database, and leaving and reopening the app will not reset or change the list. Finally, the app color codes tasks based on their urgency: red for overdue tasks, yellow for tasks due within a day, and green for tasks due over a day later.
